\subsection{Memory}
Results from the memory latency benchmark are
plotted as a series of data sets as shown in Figure 
~\ref{fig:f1}.

\subsubsection{RAM access time}
We followed the lmbench paper to implement 
\subsubsection{RAM bandwidth}
pass
\subsubsection{Page fault service time}
Since we don't have a filesystem, this measurement is skipped.
