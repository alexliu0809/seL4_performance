\begin{abstract}
In this project, we design and conduct experiments that measure the performance of seL4,
a formally verified kernel. 
The seL4 proofs are only valid for specific hardware architectures,
and unfortunately we do not have access to a device that is using any of the supported architecture.
Thus, we rely on the QEMU emulator to run the seL4 kernel.
