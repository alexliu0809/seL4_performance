In this project, we designed and conducted experiments that measured the performance of seL4,
a formally verified kernel. 
The seL4 proofs are only valid for specific hardware architectures,
and unfortunately we did not have access to a device that was using any of the supported architecture.
Thus, we relied on the QEMU emulator to run the seL4 kernel. 
In this report, we detailed our hardware configuration, our methodology and our results.
