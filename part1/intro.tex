\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to measure the performance of \textit{seL4},
a formally verified kernel ~\cite{klein2009sel4}. 
We are a group of two students: Peter Amidon and Enze ``Alex'' Liu. 
All of our measurements are implemented in \todo{CAmkES}, which consists of C files and other description files. 

Peter performed the first experiment on measuring the performance of CPU.

State the language you used to implement your measurements, 
and the compiler version and optimization settings you used to compile your code. 
If you are measuring in an unusual environment 
(e.g., virtual machine, Web browser, compute cloud, etc.), 
discuss the implications of the environment on the measurement task 
(e.g., additional variance that is difficult for you to control for). 
Estimate the amount of time you spent on this project.
