\section{Machine Description}

We ran all of the benchmark's on Alex's server, so its hardware
specification is the most relevant.  We used QEMU with the CPU type
set to \verb|host,+rdtscp,+invtsc| in order to ensure that the host's
TSC resources were passed through to the guest correctly.

According to \verb|/proc/cpuinfo|, the machine has an Intel i7-4770
CPU, designed for a base clock of 3.40 GHz.
