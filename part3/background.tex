\section{Background}
\subsection{Amazon Echo}
Amazon Echo is a smart speaker developed by Amazon that is connected to the Internet~\cite{wikipedia_2019}. It has an always-on microphone that starts recording automatically after hearing a certain wake word (Alexa, Echo, \textit{etc}.). Voice commands following the wake word are streamed to Amazon's cloud-based intelligent command handling program, known as Alexa, for further processing. Alexa will then try to respond to users' commands. Amazon also keeps copies of the voice commands and responses, together known as response cards~\cite{ford2019alexa}. These response cards have been made available to users by Amazon so that they can be viewed, played, and deleted~\cite{amazon_2010}.

\subsection{Wireshark}
Wireshark~\cite{wireshark_wiki} is a tool for network traffic monitoring. It can intercept and record all network traffic from a specific interface and convert that binary traffic into human-readable format. It has made it easy for humans to identify how much traffic is being sent and received, as well as who is the sender or receiver.
